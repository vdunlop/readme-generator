Execute by going to the above URL. You will be brought to a screen with an input box and Search button.

Enter the city, state (abbreviated) that you would like to see weather information on.

Your search will be saved in a list below the Search button.

The current weather will be displayed in a box on the right side of the screen.

The 5-Day forecast will be displayed below the current weather.

At this time, the user can click on one of the existing cities that have been searched for, or can enter a new search.

## Usage
The Weather Dashboard can be used for several purposes:

1. An easy way to look up the weather for a city. You will receive current weather and a 5-Day forecast.

2. An easy way to look up the weather for several cities. By searching for a city, you will see the current weather and 5-Day forecast, and then be able to click on past cities that you have searched for. This makes for an easy way to compare weather in many cities if, for example, you are scheduling a trip and want to know what order to visit the sites in.
